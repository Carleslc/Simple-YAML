[![Latest version](https://jitpack.io/v/Carleslc/Simple-YAML.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Carleslc/Simple-YAML) [![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML)

_This Java API provides an easy-to-use way to store data and provide configurations using the YAML format._

## What is YAML?

YAML is a human-readable data-oriented serialization language.

Serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

You can learn more about YAML language [here](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html). Specifically, if you're interested to learn about the YAML syntax you can go to the
[Chapter 2 of the YAML specification](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Preview).

Filename extensions: `.yaml`, `.yml`

## What is Simple-YAML?

Simple-YAML is a library designed to create configuration files for your programs, tools and plugins.

The API is a port from [Bukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit) configuration wrapper with some features added, so you can use this library wherever you want without Bukkit dependency.

Simplicity is added with the [`YamlFile`](https://carleslc.me/Simple-YAML/doc/Simple-Yaml/org/simpleyaml/configuration/file/YamlFile.html) class, which has everything you need with easy use for creation, management and serialization of yaml files. It is an extension of [`YamlConfiguration`](https://carleslc.me/Simple-YAML/doc/Simple-Yaml/org/simpleyaml/configuration/file/YamlConfiguration.html).

Furthermore, you can optionally save your files with **comments** in mind. You can write your comments with a text editor as usual.
In addition, not only you can preserve your comments but also with this API you can read and add comments programmatically to your configuration. Sounds good, right?

## How to install

To use this API all you need is to download the [latest Simple-Yaml.jar](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML/releases) and put it as a dependency on your project.

### Maven

If you are using Maven you do not need to download the jar. Instead, add this repository and dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>jitpack.io</id>
      <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

  <summary>Yaml + Configuration</summary>

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>me.carleslc.Simple-YAML</groupId>
    <artifactId>Simple-Yaml</artifactId>
    <version>1.8</version>
</dependency>
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configuration only</summary>

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>me.carleslc.Simple-YAML</groupId>
    <artifactId>Simple-Configuration</artifactId>
    <version>1.8</version>
</dependency>
```

</details>

### Gradle

If you are using Gradle you do not need to download the jar. Instead, add this repository and dependency to your build file:

```gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Yaml + Configuration</summary>

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation 'me.carleslc.Simple-YAML:Simple-Yaml:1.8'
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configuration only</summary>

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation 'me.carleslc.Simple-YAML:Simple-Configuration:1.8'
}
```

</details>

## How to use

The best way to learn how to use this API is through some examples.

You can find some examples to test [here](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML/tree/master/Simple-Yaml/src/test/java/org/simpleyaml/examples).

* [`YamlExample`](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML/blob/master/Simple-Yaml/src/test/java/org/simpleyaml/examples/YamlExample.java): An example to create YAML files, save or delete values and move through the file configuration.
* [`YamlCommentsExample`](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML/blob/master/Simple-Yaml/src/test/java/org/simpleyaml/examples/YamlCommentsExample.java): An example to load and save YAML files keeping comments and also how to read and add comments programmatically.
* [`YamlCommentsFormatExample`](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML/blob/master/Simple-Yaml/src/test/java/org/simpleyaml/examples/YamlCommentsFormatExample.java): An example to format header and comments with custom prefixes, suffixes and blank lines.
* [`YamlEncodingExample`](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML/blob/master/Simple-Yaml/src/test/java/org/simpleyaml/examples/YamlEncodingExample.java): A minimal example to check your encoding with Unicode characters.
* [`YamlSerializationExample`](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML/blob/master/Simple-Yaml/src/test/java/org/simpleyaml/examples/YamlSerializationExample.java): An example for saving complex objects using serialization.
* [`Person`](https://github.com/Carleslc/Simple-YAML/blob/master/Simple-Yaml/src/test/java/org/simpleyaml/examples/Person.java): An example of class for complex objects used in the previous file. Here you can see how to serialize and deserialize objects.
